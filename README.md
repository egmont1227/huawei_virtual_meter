# Huawei Virtual Meter for Home Assistant

![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/kmotr/huawei_virtual_meter)
![HACS](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)

This custom integration for Home Assistant acts as a **virtual Modbus TCP server**, emulating a **Huawei Smart Power Sensor** (Smart Meter). It allows you to feed real-time power, voltage, current, and energy data from any Home Assistant entity directly into your Huawei SCharger (Smart Charger).

By utilizing this integration, your Huawei SCharger will automatically discover the virtual meter on your local network and use its data for dynamic power control, surplus solar charging logic (PV excess charging), and charging statistics—without requiring a physical Huawei Smart Power Sensor.

## Features

- 🔋 **Seamless Integration:** Emulates the official "3.3 Meter Equipment Register" Modbus map required by Huawei SChargers.
- 📡 **Auto-Discovery:** Simulates the Huawei UDP discovery protocol, allowing the SCharger to find the meter automatically. The discovery port is configurable (default `6600` for older firmware, `10086` for SPC231+).
- ⚙️ **Direct UI Configuration:** Configure, map, and edit all your Modbus registers directly from the Home Assistant UI. No YAML required!
- 🎛️ **Entity & Fixed Value Support:** Map live Home Assistant entities (e.g., `sensor.grid_power`) or set fixed values (e.g., a static `230V` for voltage) for specific registers.
- 🧮 **Automatic Data Handling:** Automatically manages data types (`INT16`, `UINT16`, `INT32`), correct 32-bit value splitting (High/Low words), and applies the required Huawei scaling factors (gains).

## Installation

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)
1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Click on the 3 dots in the top right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
3. Add the URL of this repository and select **Integration** as the category.
4. Click **Install** and restart Home Assistant.

### Method 2: Manual
1. Download the latest release `.zip` file from the [Releases page](../../releases).
2. Extract the `huawei_virtual_meter` folder.
3. Copy the folder into your Home Assistant's `custom_components/` directory.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

1. In Home Assistant, navigate to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. Click **+ ADD INTEGRATION** and search for **Huawei Virtual Meter Emulator**.
3. During the initial setup:
   - **Emulator IP Address:** Select the IP address of your Home Assistant instance that the SCharger should connect to.
   - **Serial Number:** Provide a simulated serial number (default `HV0000000001` is fine).
   - **UDP Discovery Port:** Set the port for the Huawei UDP discovery protocol. Use `6600` for older SCharger firmware (pre-SPC231). Use `10086` for SCharger firmware `V100R023C10SPC231` and later. You can change this later via **Settings** > **Edit settings**.
4. After adding the integration, click on **CONFIGURE** to map your registers.

## Mapping Registers

Click **CONFIGURE** on the integration page. You will see three options:

1. **Add a new register mapping:**
   - Choose the register you want to provide data for (e.g., `Register 37113: Active power`).
   - On the next screen, you can select the **Home Assistant Entity** you want to map to this register.
   - *Alternatively*, you can provide a **Fixed Value** (e.g., `1` for the "Meter Type" register).
   - The scaling factor (e.g., `10` or `100`) is automatically pre-filled according to the official Huawei Modbus specifications, but you can adjust it if your sensor requires it.
2. **Edit configured registers:**
   - Displays a complete table of all your currently mapped registers.
   - You can quickly adjust entities, fixed values, and factors all in one place.
   - To **delete** a register, simply clear both the Entity ID and the Fixed Value fields and click Submit.
3. **Edit settings:**
   - Change the **UDP Discovery Port** without recreating the integration.
   - Use `6600` for older SCharger firmware (pre-SPC231) or `10086` for SCharger firmware `V100R023C10SPC231` and later.
   - Changing the port requires reloading the integration to take effect.

### Common Huawei Registers
To get started, you will typically want to map at least the following:
- **37113 (Active power):** Your total home grid consumption/export. (Positive = exporting to grid / surplus available, Negative = consuming from grid).
- **37125 (Meter type):** Usually set as a **Fixed Value**: `0` for Single-Phase, `1` for Three-Phase.
- **37101, 37103, 37105 (Phase Voltages):** Can be mapped to voltage sensors or set to a fixed value like `230`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Address already in use:** The integration runs a Modbus TCP server on port `502` and a UDP discovery listener (default port `6600`, or `10086` for SPC231+ firmware). Ensure no other add-ons or integrations on your Home Assistant OS are occupying these ports.
- **SCharger doesn't connect:** Ensure that your SCharger is on the same local network subnet as your Home Assistant instance, as UDP broadcasts are used for discovery.
- **Wrong UDP discovery port:** SCharger firmware `V100R023C10SPC231` and later changed the UDP discovery port from `6600` to `10086`. If your SCharger is running SPC231+, go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Huawei Virtual Meter Emulator** > **CONFIGURE** > **Edit settings** and set the UDP Discovery Port to `10086`. Then reload the integration.
- **SCharger sends TLS on port 502:** SChargers with firmware SPC231 enforce TLS-secured Modbus (MBAS) when the discovery handshake is not completed. Ensuring the UDP discovery port is correct (10086 for SPC231+) allows the SCharger to receive the discovery response and establish a non-TLS connection.
